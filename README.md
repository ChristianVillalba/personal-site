# Personal-Site
This is a static site (HTML , CSS &amp; JS)

This project combines two different templates from startbootstrap.com: "Agency" & "Resume". \
I liked the structure available in "Resume" but I needed a portfolio section to include my projects,    
and the section in "Agency" was what I was looking for.       
I personalized the content and the styles working directly with the Bootstrap Repository instead of            
using the CDN in order to custom the elements and get used to the elements available in this framework.

This project includes links to my GitHub Page and my LinkedIn Profile.

The projects in my portfolio are:     
* Drum Kit    
* Simon Game     
* Django: Social Media Site     
* "This site": instead of open a project, it will describe this site and takes to the Repository on GitHub.\

All the projects refer to technical skills listed on the "SKILLS" section on the Site:\
Django, JavaScript , jQuery & Bootstrap.\
All the projects except this site were created following some tutorial , however,\
I personalized every single project to add some functionality, change the style or make the design responsive to different viewports.\
Each project includes a brief description and a link to its repository on GitHub.

The section "CERTIFICATIONS" includes links to the certifications I obtained by finishing the listed courses.
