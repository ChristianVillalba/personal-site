# personal-site
This is a static site (HTML , CSS &amp; JS) 

This project combines two different templates from startbootstrap.com: "Agency" & "Resume". \
I liked the structure available in "Resume" but I needed a portfolio section to include my projects and the section in "Agency" was what I was looking for.\ 
I personalized the content and the styles working directly with the Bootstrap Repository instead of using the CDN in order to custom the elements.\

The projects in my portfolio are:
-Drum Kit
-Simon Game
-Django: Social Media Site
-"This site" instead of open a project, it will describe this site and takes to the Respository on GitHub
