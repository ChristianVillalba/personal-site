# personal-site
This is a static site (HTML , CSS &amp; JS) 

This project combines two different templates from startbootstrap.com: "Agency" & "Resume". \
I liked the structure available in "Resume" but I needed a portfolio section to include my projects and the section in "Agency" was what I was looking for.\ 
I personalized the content and the styles working directly with the Bootstrap Repository instead of using the CDN in order to custom the elements.\

The projects in my portfolio are:
-Drum Kit
-Simon Game
-Django: Social Media Site
-"This site": instead of open a project, it will describe this site and takes to the Respository on GitHub.\
All the projects refer to technical skills listed on my "Skills" section on the Site:\
Django, JavaScript , jQuery & Bootstrap.\
All the projects except this site were created following some tutorial , however,\ 
I personalized every single project to add some functionality, change the style or make the design responsive to different viewports.
